# C-Projects
This is a collection of my C++ projects.

1. 100 Games
This is a game I created with my colleagues(Diana and Joel) called 100 Games. In this game, you take turns with AI to get to 100 first. Nobody has ever beaten AI. Will you be the first?
2. Tic Tac Toe 
This is a game my colleagues(Diana and Joel) and I were tasked to develop as our project. Tic tac toe is a classic. A two player game where one tries to win by crossing three X's or O's on a 3X3 grid. Do you have what it takes to play against AI?
