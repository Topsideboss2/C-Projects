# C-Projects
This is a collection of my C++ projects.

1. 100 Games
This is a game I created with my colleagues(Diana and Joel) called 100 Games. In this game, you take turns with AI to get to 100 first. Nobody has ever beaten AI. Will you be the first?
2. Tic Tac Toe 
This is a game my colleagues(Diana and Joel) and I were tasked to develop as our project. Tic tac toe is a classic. A two player game where one tries to win by crossing three X's or O's on a 3X3 grid. Do you have what it takes to play against AI?
3. 3n+1 Game
This is a lovely little unsolved problem that is incredibly simple to relate, but virtually impossible to get anywhere with. It goes like this: say you pick a number and generate a sequence based on the following two rules; 
	(i). If your number is odd, multiply it by 3 and add 1 
	(ii). If your number is even, divide it by 2
Now the loop ends when you get a 1. Now the most astonishing thing is that no matter what number you start with, you always seem to come back to 1 eventually. But nobody knows if it's true for ALL numbers, and no one can prove it. That is why I decided to prove it with this code.
