This is a directory of my simple arduino projects. I will be constantly uploading new projects over time.
1. LCD
This is a simple arduino LCD that prints what you tell it to. Used the LiquidCrystal library that is not difficult to implement. Simple functions such as lcd.print(), lcd.setCursor(), lcd.clear(), lcd.begin()
